2) Change the name of the directory containing this module to micelle/.

3) Modify the makefile fragent src/mcMd/sources.mk to include the file
src/mcMd/modules/micelle/sources.mk and add a line adding the variable
$(mcMd_modules_micelle_) to $(mcMd_modules_), as described in the file
src/mcMd/modules/README.
